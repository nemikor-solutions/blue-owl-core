# Running the devices

1. Edit the config.cmd file to 
  - set the location of the MQTT Server, the username and password
  - set the communication port used to talk to the Arduino.

2. If you are running more than one device from the same computer, or if the port is not detected automatically
  - edit the script to uncomment the line that sets the port
  - set the port to the device where your Arduino is connected.
