# WOKWI scripts and alternate pinouts

This directory contains working simulations of the devices.

The .ts files define the pin mappings that blue-owl uses.
The diagram.json files define the mapping of the physical components as used by Wokwi.

Instructions for running are found in the sketch.ino file for each directory.
