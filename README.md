# Blue Owl

Blue Owl provides Technical Official device integration for [OWLCMS](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4/) via a microcontroller powered by [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/).

Blue Owl currently provides functionality related to referees only. Support for a jury and timekeeper are planned.

## Referees

Referee control boxes may be used in compliance with the IWF Referee Light System as documented in TCRR 3.3.6. The referee control boxes support:

* White and red buttons for "Good lift" and "No lift".
* White and red LEDs to confirm decision entry.
* Buzzer and/or vibration to signal when a decision is required.

### Single Referee Mode

Blue Owl supports a single referee mode for competitions run with only one referee. When only one referee control box is configured, it will send a decision for all three referees.
